My name is Roshan Ramankutty. I am a graduating senior at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science and Engineering and I'm looking for a Software Engineering internship this summer. It is a dream of mine to work in Software Engineering or Product/Content Design at Khan Academy. I may be a programmer, but I want to teach one day and I think Khan Academy leads the way in advancing education across the board. 

I am confident that I am a good candidate for these positions because I have aimed to work in this space for some time - as a result, I have spent time working on projects that serve similar purposes to Khan Academy. As briefly mentioned in my resume, I'm working with a company to deploy educational services to spaces in rural Nepal. My experience working with this company has given me a strong understanding on how to work with others in larger engineering projects, as well as a strong understanding as to what constraints we work with when developing a product for a profoundly different market.

I believe my extra-curriculars have also prepared me well for the kinds of work that Khan Academy is looking for. As the Vice President of my school's ACM chapter, I worked alongside my team to build hackathons and host tutorials on computer languages and technologies. Though it is a bit informal, I believe that through those experiences I have learned a lot about what it takes to create positive, engaging, and rich activities taht students want to participate in; I also believe that I could bring these insights to Khan Academy and help create more of these positive experiences.

Khan Academy has a lot to offer me. Not only is it a chance to work on something with a grander impact, but the chance to learn from people in this space in the industry I think would be invaluable. I don't think it is possible to make a dent in the world if you don't aim to learn from the leaders of it. 

Feel free to contact me in any way listed here or on my resume. I look forward to hearing from you! Thank you so much for your time.
